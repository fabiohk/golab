# Hello World!

A classic! It's just a small piece of code that illustrate how to print in the standard output some characters.

## Requirements

You'll only need the GO compiler installed! It should run in any GO version!

## How to build

Type the following in your terminal console:

```bash
go build -o bin/hello src/hello.go
```

It'll compile the code, building the Hello World app!

## Running

If you passed the build section without any problems, just type:

```bash
./bin/hello
```

And you should see the following in your terminal console:

```bash
Hello,
world!
```

With that, we've succesfully made our first GO program!
