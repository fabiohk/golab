# GO Lang Laboratory

Another random repository with random code written in Go.


## Description

Since it's not a well-defined project, this repository may have a different folder structure. You can find here any kind of code that I find interesting to hone my skills, from Hello World! to anything. So here, in the root, you won't find anything really interesting, all the code should be in the sub-folders, that **must** contain an **README** file that give instructions on the purpose and how to run the code.
