# GO Lang Laboratory

Another random repository with random code written in Go.


## Description

Since it's not a well-defined project, this repository may have a different folder structure. You can find here any kind of code that I find interesting to hone my skills, from Hello World! to anything. So here, in the root, you won't find anything really interesting, all the code should be in the sub-folders, that **must** contain an **README** file that give instructions on the purpose and how to run the code.

### Folder structure

In this repository, you'll find the following structure:

```bash
root
├── README.md (this one!)
├── any-app
└── hello-world
    ├── README.md
    └── src
        └── hello.go
```

I may change this at any time, if I find it necessary.
